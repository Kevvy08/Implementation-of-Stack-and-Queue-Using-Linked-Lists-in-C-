# Implementation-of-Stack-and-Queue-Using-Linked-Lists-in-C-
To design and implement two fundamental data structures — Stack and Queue — using linked lists in C++ and provide basic operations like push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, and display.
# Project Title

This repository contains:
- `main.cpp`: Source code for implementation of stack and queue using linked lists:
            Stacks and Queues are core concepts in Data Structures.  A Stack follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), where the last inserted element is the first to be
            removed.  A Queue follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO), where the first inserted element is the first to be
            removed.
            In this project, both structures are implemented using linked lists, allowing dynamic memory allocation
            and avoiding limitations like fixed size.
-          `report.pdf`: Project report documenting the objectives, methodology, and results.
